An invisible creature can always try to hide.

However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"ae6e6e9c-deeb-46a2-8501-af714b7637ff\"><strong>Passive Perception.</strong>&nbsp;When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p>\n<p data-content-chunk-id=\"5c06e716-9f55-4b8f-90b8-abfeeda8357d\"><strong>What Can You See?</strong>&nbsp;One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be&nbsp;lightly&nbsp;or&nbsp;heavily obscured, as explained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring\" data-content-chunk-id=\"a50c65eb-e88e-4f9d-9b45-028cb378e737\">chapter 8</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>"}

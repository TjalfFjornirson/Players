The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&rsquo;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&rsquo;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"null (pg. 261)","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":24,"units":"hour"},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":300,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":7,"school":"con","components":{"value":"a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at least 5 gp","consumed":false,"cost":5,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""},"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"flags":{"vtta":{"dndbeyond":{"lookup":"classSpell","class":"Wizard","level":20,"spellLevel":7,"spellSlots":{"spell0":{"value":null},"spell1":{"value":4,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell4":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell5":{"value":3,"max":3},"spell6":{"value":2,"max":2},"spell7":{"value":2,"max":2},"spell8":{"value":1,"max":1},"spell9":{"value":1,"max":1}},"ability":"int","mod":1,"dc":15,"cantripBoost":false,"overrideDC":false,"tags":["Utility","Exploration"]}},"betterRolls5e":{"quickVersatile":{"altValue":true}},"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"modules/SharedData_Player/img/Spells/School/conjuration.webp"}

When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target.

On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.</p>\n<p>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>\n                    \n                            <span class=\"components-blurb\">* - (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)</span>"},"source":"PHB 214","activation":{"type":"hour","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":10,"units":"day"},"target":{"value":200,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":60,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":8,"school":"enc","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"Either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"cantrip","formula":""},"attributes":{"spelldc":10}},"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false},"mess":{"isBonusDamage":false,"templateTexture":""},"betterCurses":{"isCurse":false,"mw":false,"rw":false,"ms":false,"rs":false,"curseName":"","formula":""}},"img":"modules/SharedData_Player/img/Spells/School/enchantment.webp","effects":[]}

The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Spirit stat block below. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The creature physically resembles a misshapen humanoid marked by the chosen emotion, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block.The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.</p>\n<p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell’s level in its stat block.</p>\n<div class=\"Basic-Text-Frame stat-block-finder\">\n<p

You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress&rsquo;s outer wall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell.
